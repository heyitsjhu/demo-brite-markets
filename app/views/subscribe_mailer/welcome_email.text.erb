Hi there!

====================================================
Thank you for testing out my demo Rails application!
====================================================

(Un)fortunately, you didn't actually sign up for anythingâ€”so yay, no spam! 
The Brite Markets demo application is just a way to showcase my current design 
and development skills. The code itself is on GitHub and can be viewed at:

If you'd like to get in touch, free to email me at <%= @email_address %> 
or visit my website: www.iamjhu.com. I'd love to hear from you!

Thank you again for stopping by my demo application and testing its functionality!

Cheers,
