# Brite Markets - Demo Rails Application

This is a simple Rails application that originated as a landing page assignment at [Designlab](http://www.trydesignlab.com). I decided to use Action Mailer to set up the subscription functionality. While an email is fired off when you enter your email, you aren't actually subscribing to anything! None of the navigation links work, as the focus of the page is the CTAs (call-to-action) which is the subscription sign up.

The demo application can be viewed [here](https://demo-brite-markets.herokuapp.com/). It may take a few seconds for Heroku to wake the application from its sleeping state.
